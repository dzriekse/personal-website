For two summers, I worked as part of a student-led 7 person team at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory on a project to create a K-band CubeSat to provide a beacon to calibrate ground
stations for the high wavelength. As part of this project, I worked on the RF chain from the oscillator to the horn antenna. We modeled the antenna and gain pattern using MATLAB 
and devised a polarization switching scheme with waveguides using an OMT to switch between LHCP and RHCP. Futhermore, I also created and tested the flight software interfacing our PUMPKIN GNSS
receiver and our motherboard using I2C and UART communication protocols. My work was CUI and not licensed for export and thus I can't provide the materials directly. However,
feel free to reach out to learn more about my work!
