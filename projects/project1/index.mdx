During my senior year of high school at TJHSST, I worked in a senior research project to model how the quantum state evolves during stimulated Raman adiabatic passage (STIRAP)
using the time dependent schrodinger equation in MATLAB. This work was done in collaboration with my peers Ishara Shanmugasundaram and Laura Guo and under the direction of 
Mark Hannum.
