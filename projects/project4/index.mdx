This most recent summer, I worked at Argonne National Laboratory as part of the DOE's SULI program. As part of the 10 week program, I worked under the direction of Orlando Quaranta
on creating a shunt resistor chip for use in the TES's currently being tested at Argonne's Advanced Photon Source. The chips we were using previously were manufactured by NIST,
and we were looking to be able to produce chips in house. After the end of the 10 week program, I was extended on the project and worked on the theoretical suporconductor 
mathematics, trying to find a model that represents unohmic behavior in the bilayer due to proximity effect. I also contributed software analysis and mapping of TES data to 
readable graphs to be presented at the Applied Superconductivity Conference later this year.
