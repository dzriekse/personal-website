At the beginning of freshman year, I joined the UChicago PULSE-A team, which is creating a CubeSat to prove our capability to perform free space laser communication from low Earth orbit.
I joined the team as an avionics flight computer engineer and now serve as the avionics hardware department lead. During my time, I have created and tested the amplifier for
the quadcell, a four quadrant photodiode, on the payload. 

We presented two papers that I worked on for SmallSat 2025:  Development of an Open-Source Spacecraft Bus for the PULSE-A CubeSat and Development of a Compact Optical Communications Terminal for the PULSE-A CubeSat
